# Spotify-Creator
Created a flask app that uses the Spotify API to search songs. I implemented a login and register feature where logged-in users will have access to view and customize a playlist that will be stored in Mongodb. The front page allows the user to search for a song and populate results. The user then has the option to click into the artists of that song where the app displays each artistâ€™s top 10 tracks. The search displays the artist, album, and song related to the query. If the user is logged in then they can add songs to their playlist, and users will have the option to be able to change their account settings such as profile picture, username, and password. All of this information will be stored in MongoDB.
